# Regression Project  

This project is based on applying different regression techniques to predict continuous values.  
The focus was mainly on **Random Forest (Regression)** and **Boosting (Regression)** models, with proper preprocessing and tuning steps.  

---

## Dataset  
- Dataset was downloaded online (not offically mentioned).  

---

## Methodology  
1. Data Cleaning  
2. Feature Encoding and Scalling  
3. Model Training  
4. Model Evaluation (using r2_score, mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error)  
5. Hyperparameter Tuning (with Grid Search CV and Randamized Search CV)  
6. Re-Evaluation of models with the same metrics  

---

## What I Learned  
- How Random Forest and Boosting techniques are applied for regression tasks.  
- Importance of encoding, scaling and proper preprocessing before training.  
- How tuning hyper parameters can improve prediction accuracy.  

---

## Project Updates  
- This was one of my bigger regression projects.  
- The next upcoming project will be on **classification models**.  

Thank you everyone for taking a look!
